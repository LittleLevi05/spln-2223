### 🎲 <a name="quiz">Quiz game</a> 

A random complex sentence from the book is selected. With the firsts five words from the sentence, six fake sentences is generated. The goal is the user guess the true sentence.

)

### 🎚️ <a name="projection"> Projection </a>

Some operations can be very time consuming with is being considered the hole content of the book. So, with the user wants to make the operation only in a limited part of the book, **projections** can be used. Every other flag used with the projection flag, only operates in the projection content. The projection syntax is like access an array in Python: *the book's content is abstracted into a list of sentences*. If the user wants to **view** the projection of the first 3 sentences of the book, it can be used **-v** flag.

)

### 🌐 <a name="translation">Translation</a> 

The **translation** feature only works for texts with a number of words less than 512. This means that is possible to translate a hole paragraph! The program have support to translate only texts written in **English**. The languages available to translate are **French**, **German** and **Romanian**. The following example made the translation of the previous book projection.

)

### 🌐 <a name="language">**Language detection**</a>

In order to detect the language of the book, the user can execute:

)

### 🔍 <a name="match">**Match of input phrase with a similar story excert**</a>

Sometimes the user wants to read again a certain excert from the book, but only remember a short description of this part. In order to find this part of the book, the user can write what he remembers and the program returns the part of the book which is more similar in terms of subject to what was passed.

### 🕸️ <a name="fetch">**Fetch a book from web**</a>

TODO: Alex

### 📁 <a name="archiver">**Book archiver**</a>

The **archiver** features allow the user to save the book in a database by using the argument **--save TITLE**. By using the arguments **--view** and **--read TITLE**, it is possible to read the content of the book saved. 

```
~ $ story_analyzer harry1.txt out --save "Harry Potter"
~ $ story_analyzer out --read "Harry Potter" --view
~ $ cat out.json
{
    "view": "/ \n\n\n\n\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive ...
       ..."
}
```
Another use case of this feature is the use of the **--save TITLE** argument followed by queries. Instead of just saving the content of the book it will also save the queries asked by the user. By doing this it is possible to use the **archive** as a cache, thus reducing the total time of the queries saved. 
```
~ $ story_analyzer out --read "Harry Potter" --sentence_no --language --save "Harry Potter"
~ $ story_analyzer out --read "Harry Potter" --sentence_no --language
~ $ cat out.json
{
    "sentence_no": 6472,
    "language": "English"
}
```

**Not all the queries will be deemed as savable**. Similar sentences and Sentiment Analysis will not be saved.

Another thing to beware is the fact that it is **not supported to do a projection** of a book saved in the archive. This is due to the fact that a projection will change the books content. However in order to optimize the queries that require a spacy analyzis, the Doc object is saved in the archive. If the user were to do a projection on a read and then use the **--save** argument then the doc saved would not reflect the projection, thus it would not be coherent with the expected result. For future work, it would be interesting to implement a way to support this feature.

Example that is **not** supported
```
~ $ story_analyzer out --read "Harry Potter" --projection [1:100] --save "Harry Potter"
```
